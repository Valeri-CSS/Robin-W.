### What I learned

Making this website I used Anchor Tags to build the webseit like a one page wich includes different pages. This style of webpages was for me a very nice experience, also I learnd hot to create a function in JS to use this for the same classes for example to add some of the EventListener.  Also I improved my Flexbox and Grid skills.
